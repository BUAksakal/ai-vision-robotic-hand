# 🤖 AI Vision Controlled Robotic Hand
**Bachelor’s Final Thesis Project**

A real-time computer vision system that controls a 3D-printed robotic hand using AI-based hand detection and embedded control logic.

This project combines **Computer Vision**, **Embedded Systems**, and **Real-Time Interaction** to demonstrate how AI can directly control physical robotic hardware.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this thesis project was to design and implement an intelligent robotic hand capable of interacting with human hand movements in real time.

The system detects hand gestures via camera input and translates them into servo motor commands through Arduino communication. A safety mechanism automatically releases the grip after a defined duration to prevent excessive force.
