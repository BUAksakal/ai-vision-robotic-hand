# 🤖 AI Vision Controlled Robotic Hand
**Bachelor’s Final Thesis Project**

This project presents a real-time computer vision system that controls a 3D-printed robotic hand using AI-based detection and embedded control logic. The main objective was to bridge artificial intelligence and physical robotics by translating human hand movements into real robotic actions.

The system captures live video input and processes it using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **YOLOv8** for real-time hand detection and tracking. To improve robustness, I created a custom dataset by manually capturing and labeling images under different lighting conditions and hand positions using **Roboflow**. Detected gestures are interpreted in Python and transmitted to an **Arduino** microcontroller through serial communication, enabling real-time control of servo motors driving the robotic hand.

A safety mechanism was implemented to automatically release the grip after a predefined timeout, preventing excessive force and protecting both hardware and users. This project demonstrates a full AI-to-robotics pipeline integrating **Computer Vision**, **Embedded Systems**, and **Human–Machine Interaction** in a practical, real-world application.

### 📊 Custom Dataset Creation
To train the detection model, I captured and labeled my own images of the robotic hand. This custom dataset improved detection stability and allowed reliable performance in real-world scenarios.

### 🤖 Hardware Setup
The robotic hand was fully 3D-printed and controlled via Arduino-driven servo motors. Real-time commands generated by the vision model were translated into physical movement.
